# Synthetic Dataset Creation
## Dataset:
Let's imagine one of the leading retail stores in the US, like Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day, which are being scrapped for each year using Python. 
The store runs one promotional markdown event throughout the year, which is Black Friday (should be added any other ones if needed), which day is being calculated using Python. The weeks including this holiday are much higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. 
Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of synthetic data. 
Sales data for 4 stores with different sale rates located in different regions are available (should be added any quantity of stores).
